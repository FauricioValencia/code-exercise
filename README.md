# Intro

For this exercise, we want to build an app to work with time and expense data. The data is contained in two CSV files called time.csv and expenses.csv. Below, you'll find a few stories that we'd like to implement. Please read through them and let us know if you have any questions. Please note that we've included wireframes for each story so that you can get a visual of the desired functionality. Since these are wireframes, you're free to implement the styling however you feel is the most practical and intuitive. Do your best to make things look nice, but don't feel like the the UI has to be perfect. What we're most concerned about is Javascript - not CSS / HTML.

If you need a UI library, please use Material UI. For everything else, feel free to use any library that you think will make things easier. Google whatever you want. That said, we want to see what you're capabable of as an individual programmer, so please don't get anyone else's help on this project. If you need clarification on anything, please reach out to us and we'll be happy to provide clarification.

Please try to use a functional approach (filter/map/reduce, immutability, etc.) when writing the code instead of an imperative approach (for/while, mutations, etc.).

# Stories

## Users should be able to see entries

The wireframe for this story is wireframes/see_entries.png

As a User,  
Because I want to be able to see time and expense entries,  
When I click on the "Upload CSV" button,  
Then I should be able to select a file from my computer containing time entries,  
And when I select a file from my computer,  
Then I should see the list of entries that I uploaded from the file displayed in a table,  
And when I click the "Upload CSV" button again,  
Then I should be able to select another file from my computer containing expense entries,  
And when I select a file from my computer,  
Then the new entries should be added to the table,  
And I should be able to see the entries from both CSV files in the table,

Notes: 
- We want to parse the the CSV on the frontend using the [File Reader API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader/readAsDataURL#Example). Please don't worry about sending the CSV to the server.
- If you're applying for a fullstack position, please store the time and expense data in MongoDB via the Express server that we have setup. We setup a couple of example endpoints to just make sure that everything is wired together correctly. Please feel free to change it as you see fit. If you're just applying for a frontend position, you don't need to worry about working on the endpoints or storing the data in the database.

## Users should be able to see the total dollar amount for entries

The wireframe for this story is wireframes/totals.png

As a User,  
Because I want to know how much money I've billed in time and expenses,  
When I'm viewing entries that I've uploaded from a CSV,  
Then I should see one total for time,  
And I should see another total for expenses,  
And I should see another total for time and expenses combined.  

## Users should be able to sort entries

The wireframes for this story are wireframes/sorting_first_time.png, wireframes/sorting_second_time.png, and wireframes/sorting_different_column.png

As a User,  
Because I want to be able easily find specific entries,  
When I click on the name of a column,  
Then I should see a down arrow next to the name of the column,  
And the entries should be sorted by that column descending,  
And if I click on the name of the column again,  
Then the arrow next to the column name should point up,  
And I should see the entries should be sorted by that column ascending,  
And if I click on the name of another column,  
Then the down arrow should disappear from the previous column name and should appear next to the column name that I just clicked,  
And the entries should be sorted by that column descending.

# Development

Fork this repo and open a PR against the master branch of your repo. (Please don't open the PR against this repo). When you're ready to share your solution with us, send us a link to the PR (or PRs if you're opening more than 1) in your forked repo so that we can review. If you need a UI library, use Material UI.

## Installation

The project was bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for the client and a simple [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) server with [Mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose). To install the app:

1. Make sure you have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) installed.
2. Make sure you have [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) installed. (Fullstack developers only.)
3. Run `yarn install`.

## Run the app

1. Start up the client with Webpack dev server using create-react-app's default settings: `yarn start:client`.
2. Start the Mongo daemon: `mongod` (Fullstack developers only.)
3. Run `yarn start:server` to start up Express server with [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon). (Fullstack developers only.)

Happy coding! :rocket:
